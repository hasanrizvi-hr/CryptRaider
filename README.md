# CryptRaider
#AboutGame
Crypt Raider is an exciting and challenging adventure game that takes players on a journey through ancient tombs and temples filled with hidden treasures and dangerous traps.
Players take on the role of a daring adventurer searching for valuable artifacts in a maze of crypts, avoiding deadly traps and solving challenging puzzles along the way.


The game is set in a beautifully detailed, 3D environment with realistic lighting effects and atmospheric sound.
Players must navigate through the crypts, using their wits and skill to uncover secrets and avoid danger.


#The Character Blueprint is a visual representation of the character and its properties in the game engine.
The coding for the project is done in C++ and makes use of Actor Components, which are reusable code blocks that can be attached to actors in the game. 

The C++ code makes use of pointer types to manipulate data efficiently, and the developer needs to make a choice between using references and pointers based on the specific use case.
The process of accessing the data pointed to by a pointer is known as dereferencing.

The project also involves the use of Linkers, Headers, and include statements that help the code to communicate with other parts of the project.
The Physics Handle is used to handle physical interactions in the game, while Constructors are special functions that are used to initialize objects.

The TArrays data structure is used to store collections of data and is particularly useful in game development.
The While and For Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code, and the Dependency Injection design pattern is used to provide objects with their required dependencies.

The Blueprint Callable is a feature that allows developers to call C++ functions from within the Blueprint visual scripting environment.
The Find Component by Class function is used to search for components within an actor, and the Null ptr is used to represent a null or invalid pointer.

Finally, the Boolean Logical Operators are used to perform logical operations and make decisions in the code.
They are an essential part of the coding process and help the project to function efficiently.
